# Brick-Breaker
I have made a Brick Breaker Game is masm 615 assembly Language. The code for the game is provided.

In the brick breaker game, the player moves a paddle from side to side to hit a BALL. The game
objective is to eliminate all of the BRICKS at the top of the screen by hitting them with the BALL.
But if the ball hit the bottom ENCLOSURE, the player loses and the game ends! To win the game,
all the BRICKS must be eliminated. The game is split into many levels, which must be completed
in sequence. There will be a time limit of 4 minutes and the remaining time will be shown with the
counter. The purpose of this game is to complete all the levels without losing all lives. The player
will have a maximum of 3 lives.

The basic game will consist of hitting the ball to direct it toward hitting the bricks above. When
the ball comes into contact with a brick, the brick will “break” and disappear. The player moves
the paddle from left to right to keep the ball from falling. Life is used when the player fails to hit
the ball. You have to display the number of lives left for the player on the screen. Display the
remaining lives on the screen with a HEART SHAPE. For the interaction with your game, you
will be using arrow keys on your keyboard (you can use a mouse and other keys as well). To move
the paddle, you will check for the pressed key if the pressed key is left arrow key then you will
move the paddle left and if key is right arrow key is pressed you will move the paddle to right
(change its position). The ball will bounce back from the paddle and the screen boundary walls.

When a brick breaks, a SCORE is awarded. The score depends upon the type of brick that will
break as each brick has different score. All the bricks with the same color will have same score.
Score should be displayed on screen.
